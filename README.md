ðŸ“… Airbnb Booking Management Web Application
A web application built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript to manage Airbnb bookings. It provides full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) to allow users to add, edit, delete, and view bookings.



Features:
1. Create new bookings through a user-friendly form.
2. View all bookings displayed in a responsive table.
3. Edit existing bookings and update details.
4. Delete bookings from the database.
5. Uses MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based database storage.
6. Built with Bootstrap and custom CSS for modern and responsive design.



Technologies Used:
1. Backend: Node.js, Express.js
2. Database: MongoDB Atlas
3. Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript
4. Tools: Nodemon (for live-reloading), Mongoose (for MongoDB ORM)




Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd airbnb-booking-app'


2. Install dependencies:

3. Set up MongoDB Atlas:
a. Create a free MongoDB Atlas account at MongoDB Atlas.
b. Create a new cluster and database named airbnb-bookings.
